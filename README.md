# Sir
Sir is a distributed system for information retrieval, a .Net Core Elasticsearch+Hadoop clone in early development, built on [Resin](https://github.com/kreeben/resin). Sir incarnates Resin.

## Product and market

Businesses today have learnt to collect big data. They can use a snapshot of their data to analyze the state of their systems or sales. Big data is so hard to keep around though that most businesses, even large coorporations, archive their data in hopes of finding a tool to query that archive some time in the future. Meanwhile, winning businesses, including startups with the right expertise, manage to keep most or even all of their data in a queryable state. A common setup at market-winning businesses is Elasticearch + Hadoop. They are market-winners because Hadoop-expertise is very rare, since those people work mostly for Facebook or Google.

Elasticsearch is built upon Lucene, an open-source search engine built on the Java platform. Javas strongest competitor is Microsoft's .Net platform. 

We've built Resin, a vector space model, a search/analytics framework and a document store that offers compression. Its competition is Lucene. Resin and Sir are built on .Net Core, the version of Microsoft's platform that can run on any type of operating system, including Windows and Linux, just like the Java runtime. 

Our product offering, Sir, is a distributed incarnation of Resin, a search engine and long-term data storage solution in one with aspirations of being a Elasticsearch+Hadoop replacement and the end-of-the road for your data, not by being a cemetary as most archiving solutions of today but by compressing data in a way where it is very much alive and responsive to querying even at vast scales and after many years of usage.

Machine-learning and AI will not become utilized to its full extend, or at all, if business does not solve the issue of storing and querying their big data. Sir is a crucial building block for businesses who want to conquer their data.

## Vision

In ten years from now businesses will have huge amounts of data stored in Sir or Resin, Sir's main component. The machines of that time will have as training data many years of quality data, compared to todays machines, which only have snapshots of data from windows smaller than a few months or weeks. Hadoop tooling is improved by now and they share the market with Sir, both being experts in querying long-term data stores. Sir's high data compression is used on-premise and in the cloud. All major cloud providers, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, offer Sir as a microservice.

Analysts who use Excel and SQL love Sir and Resin for giving them the ability to express complex queries with table and database joins with a query langue that is very easy to understand and implement.

Resin is used by database-builders for its indexing capabilities. 

Sir is used when web sites publishing large or vast amounts of data on the web, like Wikipedia.

Researchers use Resin to test new search models because of the ease of implementing those models and their corresponding scoring schemes. 

The market between Lucene and Resin (or between Elasticsearch+Hadoop and Sir) is either split at Linux vs Windows or Java vs .Net Core or possibly Javalang vs C#. If they are both alive and well in ten years from now they will have become each other's equals and are contemplating joining forces.
