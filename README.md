# Sir
Sir is a system for information retrieval, a .Net Core Elasticsearch+Hadoop clone in early development, built on [Resin](https://github.com/kreeben/resin).

## Product and market

Businesses today have learnt to collect big data. They can use a snapshot of their data to analyze the state of their systems or sales. Big data is so hard to keep around though that most businesses, even large coorporations, archive their data in hopes of finding a tool to query that archive some time in the future. Meanwhile, winning businesses, including startups with the right expertise, manage to keep most or even all of their data in a queryable state. A common setup at market-winning businesses is Elasticearch + Hadoop. They are market-winners because Hadoop-expertise is very rare, since those people work mostly for Facebook or Google.

Elasticsearch is built upon Lucene, an open-source search engine built on the Java platform. Javas strongest competitor is Microsoft's .Net platform. 

We've built Resin, a vector space model, a search/analytics framework and a document store that offers compression. Its competition is Lucene. Resin is built on .Net Core, the version of Microsoft's platform that can run on any type of operating system, including Windows and Linux.

Our product offering, Sir (System for Information Retrieval) is a distributed incarnation of Resin, a search engine and long-term data storage solution in one with aspirations of being a Elasticsearch+Hadoop replacement and the end-of-the road for your data, not by being a cemetary as most archiving solutions of today but by compressing data in a way where it is very much alive and responsive to querying even at vast scales and after many years of usage.

Machine-learning and AI will not become utilized to its full extend, or at all, if business does not solve the issue of storing and querying their big data. Sir is a crucial building block for businesses who want to conquer their data.

## Vision

In ten years from now businesses will have huge amounts of data stored in Sir or Resin, Sir's main component. The machines ten years from now will have as training data several years of quality data, compared to todays machines, which only have snapshots of data from windows smaller than months or weeks. Hadoop will be a thing of the past or a thing only for huge Facebook-like data. Big data will be managed in Sir.

## Team

We are a small team of two. We've know each other since childhood. We both have a background in math, more specifically, linear algebra. My partner Oscar has a engineer degree from KTH in Stockholm. I'm a self-taugh develooper with a schooling in science (biology, math, physics, chemistry, medicine). I have 17 years of professional programming experience.

Oscar and I think up ideas that we first reason about and then I do the implementing of. We are both sales people. Oscar's temperament is better seerved for administrative tasks than mine is.
